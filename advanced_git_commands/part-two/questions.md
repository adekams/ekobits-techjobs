# Git and Github

## Advanced git commands

## Part II
It's time to practice some more with everything you have learned.

* Create a local repository from the command line.

* Add and commit files.

* Push your repository up to GitHub.

* Fork and Clone https://github.com/inf-paces/learn_forking.
Add and commit some changes and submit a PR.

* Change to a different branch and add some files and merge into master when you are done.

* Practice using revert to undo commits and rebase with interactive mode for a better commit history.

* Submit another pull request, with squashed commits.
