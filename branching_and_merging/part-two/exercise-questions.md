## Branching and Merging

## Part II

Create your own merge conflict! Work on the same file on two separate branches and merge the two branches together. Fix the conflicts and finish your merge. 

In the real world you will never intentionally try to create merge conflicts, but it is important to understand how and why they are created. Most importantly, it's important not to be intimidated by merge conflicts, and to be able to fix them with confidence!
